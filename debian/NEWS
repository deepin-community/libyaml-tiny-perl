libyaml-tiny-perl (1.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The following incompatible changes are contained within this new upstream
  version:

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]

        - Previously, YAML::Tiny was sloppy about file encodings.  It is
          now strict.  The 'read' method and 'LoadFile' function expect
          UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'write' method and 'DumpFile' function
          produce UTF-8 encoded files.  The 'read_string' and
          'write_string' methods and the 'Load' and 'Dump' functions
          expect or generate (decoded) character data.

        - Previously, some errors would throw exceptions and some would
          return the error condition in $YAML::Tiny::errstr.  Now all
          errors throw exceptions.  Use of $errstr and the errstr method
          are deprecated. (David Golden)
